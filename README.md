<h2>Comments from Code reviewer Aseel:</h2>
- You succeed to use few files to create your project, and it's pretty organized, but I felt that the code is kind of complex.
- Nice use of functions in your functions.php, I didn't use it myself.
- You used a lot of "switch , case , break" and let me to be curious and read more about it, thanks.
-  In posts copy.php "line 52-52" : Nice to use $_COOKIE, I also didn't use it myself.
- I liked that you added Terms & Conditions to your website, it seems as a real website.
- In reset.css : It's good that you have written the code briefly, I'll work on that in my coming projects.
- Generally, you did a great job.
